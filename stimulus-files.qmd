# Stimulus Files

We need to track down images of 5 cats and 5 dogs, and then name them according to the scheme in @fig-xls1

In @fig-animalstimuli are a couple of examples of the ones we'll use.

We use a PsychoPy `image` component to display an image (@fig-imageComponent).

```{r, fig.link="img/pythonw_image_component_1dFQnwS2WD.png", echo=F, out.width="100%"}
#| label: fig-imageComponent
#| fig-cap: Image component
knitr::include_graphics("img/pythonw_image_component_1dFQnwS2WD.png")
```

We can set various properties of the image, including `size` and `position`.

The PsychoPy co-ordinate system has (0,0) at screen centre. Negative values represent lower and more leftwards places; Positive value correspond with higher and more rightwards places.

The `size` parameter is expressed, not as a single number to be used as a multiplier to scale the picture up and down by, but as an x value and a y value indicating how wide and tall the image should be presented. The default is a square image, 0.5 units of screen height by 0.5 units of screen height.^[other units are available including number of pixels]

From eye-balling the example pictures above in @fig-animalstimuli we can see that they are not square. If we don't set custom `size` the images will look odd, squashed in from the sides.

How do we determine the custom `size` values in such a way that the stimuli will show at their original aspect ratio?

First we need to access the dimensions of the image file. One way to do this is to use Windows Explorer which has a column for dimensions that is hidden by default.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-finddimensionsofimages
#| fig-cap: How to get the dimensions of any image
htmltools::tags$video(src = "obs/2022-07-03 14-03-11.mkv", type = "video/mp4", width="100%",  controls=1, muted=1)
```


## Aspect ratio

All our images are the same dimensions, 612 wide x 408 tall.
That is an aspect ratio of 612/408 which is 1.5:1. So, as long as the width is 1.5 times the height, the pictures will show at their native aspect ratio.

I thought the height of 0.5 was about right, so I just made the width be 1.5 * 0.5 = 0.75 for the width and 0.5 for the height, see @fig-aspectratioset

```{r, fig.link="img/pythonw_aspectauHaJqkdrj.png", echo=F, out.width="100%"}
#| label: fig-aspectratioset
#| fig-cap: Setting the correct aspect ratio
knitr::include_graphics("img/pythonw_aspectauHaJqkdrj.png")
```
