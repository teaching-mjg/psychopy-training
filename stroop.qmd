# Stroop task

Instead of building our own Stroop task, we'll take advantage of the fact that PsychoPy ships with demos.

The Stroop task allows us to see :

* how to vary the properties of our stimuli per-trial
* how to collect responses to our stimuli
* how to evaluate responses for accuracy and timing
* how to give simple feedback
* how to implement separate practice and experimental blocks
