## Flow

Bottom in the Builder - in blue in the figure.

To start with the Flow panel shows only a time-course and a single Routine named `trial`.

You build up an experiment by adding Routines to the Flow. Before the `trial` Routine, you probably want to put a `Instructions` Routine, for example. To add a Routine to the Flow, click on `Insert Routine`.

## Components

Top right in the Builder - in yellow in the figure.

The Components panel lists all the available components of an experiment: broadly speaking, stimuli and responses, so things like Text; Image; Keyboard; Mouse; Slider. 
Also includes some components that are only needed for specific kinds of experiment like eye-tracking or EEG.


## Routines

Top left in the Builder - in green in the figure.

To start with, the Routines panel shows the `trial` Routine and its timeline. There aren't any components in the `trial` Routine yet, so it looks a bit empty.

You build up an experiment by adding Components to the Routines panel. To add a Component to a Routine, click on the relevant Component.
