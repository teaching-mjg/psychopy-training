# Online

Some considerations for running online ...

* Need a pavlovia account using uni email
* Need to be logged in in the PsychoPy interface
* Write experiment using autoJs as much as possible (and "Both") for things that don't auto-translate
* Use "Sync" to push experiment up
* Change from 'piloting' to 'running'
* ...


**Use local debug mode to see whether the experiment would work in a browser at all before you puch it to pavlovia to test it**
