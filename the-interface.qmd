# The interface

Here we take a look around the interface.

The interface has 3 Windows

## Builder

The Builder is where you assemble an experiment. It is the main window.

## Runner

The Runner has 3 parts:

* a list of experiments (typically just the one you are working with at the moment, but can be several)
* a panel for alerts (can draw your attention to problems with your experiment)
* a panel called `stdout` stands for `standard out` and gives very detailed messages that can help you to fix (_debug_) your experiment.

You should try to arrange this window so that you can easily read it.

## Coder

The Coder is for advanced use and you don't usually need it open. You can close it.
